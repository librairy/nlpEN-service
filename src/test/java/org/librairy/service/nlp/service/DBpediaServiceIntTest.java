The first cyclone to attain tropical storm status was Alberto on August 8; the final storm of the year, Tropical Storm Keith, became extratropical on November 24. The season produced 19 tropical depressions, including 12 tropical storms. There were five hurricanes, including three major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffirâ€“Simpson scale). Hurricane Gilbert (pictured) was at the time the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record. It tracked through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and caused devastation in Mexico and many island nations, particularly Jamaica. Its passage caused damage valued at US$2.98 billion and more than 300 deaths, mostly in Mexico. Hurricane Joan, striking Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, caused damage valued at about $1.87 billion and more than 200 deaths.";
